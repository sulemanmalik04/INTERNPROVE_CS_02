# INTERNPROVE_CS_02
A step-by-step guide and a Python script for a Password Complexity Checker that assesses the strength of a password based on various criteria. This tool will provide feedback to users on their password's strength.

Step-by-step guide:

1. Define the criteria for password strength:
   - Length
   - Presence of uppercase letters
   - Presence of lowercase letters
   - Presence of numbers
   - Presence of special characters

2. Create functions to check each criterion:
   - check_length()
   - check_uppercase()
   - check_lowercase()
   - check_numbers()
   - check_special_chars()

3. Implement a scoring system:
   - Assign points for meeting each criterion
   - Calculate an overall score based on these points

4. Define strength levels:
   - Very Weak, Weak, Moderate, Strong, Very Strong

5. Create a main function to:
   - Take user input
   - Check the password against all criteria
   - Calculate the score
   - Determine the strength level
   - Provide feedback to the user

Now, let's create the Python script:

This script provides a comprehensive Password Complexity Checker. Here's how it works:

1. We define functions to check each criterion: length, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.

2. The `calculate_strength()` function checks the password against all criteria, calculates a score, and provides feedback for improvement.

3. The `get_strength_level()` function determines the strength level based on the score.

4. The main `password_strength_checker()` function:
   - Prompts the user for input
   - Calculates the password strength
   - Displays the strength level, score, and improvement suggestions
   - Provides a reminder about password security best practices

5. The script runs in a loop, allowing users to check multiple passwords until they choose to quit.

To use this tool:

1. Save the script as `password_checker.py`
2. Run the script: `python password_checker.py`
3. Enter passwords to check their strength
4. Type 'q' to quit the program

This implementation provides a user-friendly interface for checking password strength and offers specific suggestions for improvement. It's a valuable tool for educating users about password security and helping them create stronger passwords.
